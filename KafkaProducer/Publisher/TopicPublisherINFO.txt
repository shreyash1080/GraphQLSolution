Step 1: Creating the TopicPublisher Class
The TopicPublisher class is responsible for publishing messages to Kafka topics. To implement it, we need to fulfill the contract defined by ITopicPublisher, which requires implementing the TryPublishMessage<TKey, TMessage> method.

Why Do We Need TopicPublisher?
It centralizes message publishing logic.
It ensures proper handling of Kafka producer lifecycle.
It provides a structured way to publish messages.
Let's start by creating the class and defining necessary dependencies.

Step 2: Injecting Dependencies
Before implementing TryPublishMessage, we need a Kafka producer to send messages. Kafka provides IProducer<TKey, TValue>, which is used to publish messages.

We'll define:
_producer: The Kafka producer instance.
_logger: To log errors and information.
_config: The Kafka configuration.



The kafkaMessage object is an instance of Message<TKey, TValue>, which is required by Kafka's producer to send data.
Key = key?.ToString()
This assigns the key for the Kafka message.

Kafka uses the key for partitioning messages, ensuring that messages with the same key go to the same partition.

key?.ToString() ensures that even if key is null, it won’t cause an error (it will stay null).

Value = message?.ToString()

This is the actual payload (data) we are sending to Kafka.

Kafka only works with byte arrays or strings, so we convert the message to a string.
